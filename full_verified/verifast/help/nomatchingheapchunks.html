<p class="error">No matching heap chunks: <i>chunk pattern</i></p>
<p class="section">Context</p>
<p>When consuming a field assertion or predicate assertion.</p>
<p class="section">Cause</p>
<p>No chunk matching the field assertion or predicate assertion was found in the <a href="symbolicheap.html">symbolic heap</a>.</p>
<p class="section">Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>The program element that causes the error is shown in red, with a double underline.</li>
<li>The chunk pattern shown in the error message is an evaluated version of the assertion being consumed.</li>
<li>Consumption of a field assertion or predicate assertion occurs implicitly in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>a field access consumes (and then produces) the field predicate;</li>
<li>a <tt>free</tt> statement consumes the field predicates and the malloc block predicate of the struct instance being freed;</li>
<li>an <tt>open</tt> statement consumes the predicate being opened.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="section">Suggested solutions</p>
<p>Ensure that a matching chunk is present in the symbolic heap. Suggested approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force the current function's caller to provide the chunk. To do so, mention the chunk in the current function's <tt>requires</tt> clause.</li>
<li>If the chunk is a predicate chunk, close the predicate.</li>
<li>If the chunk is contained within a chunk that is present in the symbolic heap, open the containing chunk.</li>
<li>If the chunk can be derived from existing chunks, call a lemma function that derives the chunk.</li>
</ul>
