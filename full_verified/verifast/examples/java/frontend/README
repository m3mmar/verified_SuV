Use the Java frontend:
======================

To execute the tests in this folder,
you need to retrieve the file ast_server.jar from:

  https://bitbucket.org/gijsv/stance-java-frontend

Then you must set the environment variable 
VERIFAST_JAVA_AST_SERVER as follows:
  
  export VERIFAST_JAVA_AST_SERVER="java -jar path_to_ast_server_jar"
  
To finaly run the tests you'll need to run the following command from this directory:


Known bugs:
===========

-Desugaring of static inner classes (and other desugaring) introduces null 
 checks for its arguments, (see inner_class/MemberClass_desugard.java). 
 Currently these chekcs are ignored (i.e. thrown away) by the AstServer. For 
 member inner classes this seems not to be a problem (constructing the outer 
 class can never result in null). However, this may cause problems that we are
 currently not aware of. These null checks cannot simple be translated into an 
 if-statement that throws a NullPointerException since null checks are 
 expressions!
